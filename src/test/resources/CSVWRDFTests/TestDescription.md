# Test descriptions
Tests have been made from test set for CSV on the Web Validators available at CSVW RDF Tests (270 entries) https://w3c.github.io/csvw/tests/#manifest-rdf.
The tests have been reversed, taking the resulting RDF and expecting similar result as was the original CSV for the test.

Because of the reverse technique, not all of the tests were eligible to be reproduced outright.

Those negative tests will have a new test set ready for them.

This folder contains test sources for positive tests.

The tests are testing the following:
